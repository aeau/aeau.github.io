abstract = {With the growth of procedural content generation in game development, there is a need
for a viable generative method to give context and make sense of the content within
game space. We propose procedural narrative as context through objectives, as a useful
means to structure content in games. In this paper, we present and describe an artifact
developed as a sub-system to the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer (EDD) that procedurally
generates objectives for the dungeons created with the tool. The quality of the content
within rooms is used to generate objectives, and together with the distributions and
design of the dungeon, main and side objectives are formed to maximize the usage of
game space and create a proper context.},
