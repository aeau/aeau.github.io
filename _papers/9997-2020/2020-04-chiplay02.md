abstract = {As tabletop games are ported to digital versions to increase their accessibility,
the expected User Experience (UX) might be degraded in the transition. This paper
aims to understand how and why playing tabletop games differentiates depending on
the platform. Seven tabletop games have been chosen from different genres with an
official digital adaptation. Our approach has been to do a comparative analysis of
both versions followed by a user study to analyze and measure the UX differences,
measuring five key factors, Usability, Engagement, Social Connectivity, Aesthetics,
and Enjoyment. Our results indicate that games that rely on imperfect information
offer a much higher social connectivity and engagement when played around a table.
Meanwhile, games relying on tile-placement offers higher usability and engagement
when played digitally due to the assistance provided by the game. However, the physical
versions got, in general, a higher rating than the digital versions in all key factors
except slightly in the usability. Physical versions are the preferred options, but
the digital versions' benefits, such as accessibility and in-game assistance, makes
them relevant for further analysis.},
