Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

<strong>Title:</strong> Make Sense of Dungeons: Developing procedural narrative for EDD with the help of macro patterns.

<br>

<p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> With the growth of procedural content generation in game development, 
there is a need for a viable generation method of procedural context to make sense of the content 
within game space. Previous research discusses how interactivity and narrative are almost opposite 
of each other and when combined needs to be generated in two steps, one for the game space and the 
other for context. We propose procedural narrative as context through objectives, as a useful means 
to structure content in games. In this paper we present and describe an artefact developed as a sub-system 
to the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer (EDD), that procedurally generates objectives for the dungeons created 
with the tool. The artefact is developed with macro patterns which can be defined as an extension of 
the existing meso patterns in EDD. The macro patterns are used to generate objectives in the rooms of the dungeons, 
and the system evaluates the priority of the room objectives based on the design of the dungeon and 
the quality of the objective to maximize the usage of game space and create a suitable narrative. 
The work for this thesis and its artefact resulted in a successful expansion on the knowledge of 
procedural narrative generation by presenting macro patterns as a viable solution 
for contextualization of procedural game content.</p>
