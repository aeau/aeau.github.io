title: Supervised Theses

    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    
    <p>I am interested in supervising projects and theses on the area of Artificial Intelligence, Game Design, and their intersection, 
        as well as projects using emerging technologies such as VR or AR. Usually, I conduct supervision as weekly group supervision where students can help 
        and learn from each other while also conducting peer-reviewing of each other's chapters (every 2-3 weeks) to be in time with deadlines and the written work. 
        Nevertheless, students can always have individual supervision sessions whenever needed. I try to improve and adapt my supervision and teaching with 
        what I learn overtime and what work and doesn't work. If you want to discuss supervision/teaching methods or have any thoughts on alternative ways on doing so, 
        I would love to chat and discuss about it. If you are interested in co-supervising bachelor 
        or master students with some industry or academic project feel free to contact me aswell!

                    <strong>Title:</strong> Make Sense of Dungeons: Developing procedural narrative for EDD with the help of macro patterns.

                    <br>
                    
                    <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> With the growth of procedural content generation in game development, 
                    there is a need for a viable generation method of procedural context to make sense of the content 
                    within game space. Previous research discusses how interactivity and narrative are almost opposite 
                    of each other and when combined needs to be generated in two steps, one for the game space and the 
                    other for context. We propose procedural narrative as context through objectives, as a useful means 
                    to structure content in games. In this paper we present and describe an artefact developed as a sub-system 
                    to the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer (EDD), that procedurally generates objectives for the dungeons created 
                    with the tool. The artefact is developed with macro patterns which can be defined as an extension of 
                    the existing meso patterns in EDD. The macro patterns are used to generate objectives in the rooms of the dungeons, 
                    and the system evaluates the priority of the room objectives based on the design of the dungeon and 
                    the quality of the objective to maximize the usage of game space and create a suitable narrative. 
                    The work for this thesis and its artefact resulted in a successful expansion on the knowledge of 
                    procedural narrative generation by presenting macro patterns as a viable solution 
                    for contextualization of procedural game content.</p>

                    <strong>Title:</strong> Exploring Procedural Generation of Buildings

                    <br>
                    
                    <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> This thesis explores the procedural generation of 3D buildings from the floor
                        plan all the way to the fa¸cade and building’s details such as doors, windows,
                        and roof. Through this, the study explores several techniques and approaches
                        to create different layers of the building generation pipeline. The focus is on
                        implementing a set of algorithms that, when running sequentially, are able to
                        create complete 3D buildings in a short time (so they can be used in online
                        generation), could be used in any open-world game, and with a limited count of
                        triangles per building. Furthermore, the tool provides a clear and easy-to-use
                        interface for designers in Unity, where they can interact with the multiple parameters of each building layer, giving designers a high degree of controllability.
                        The tool is evaluated using the resulting buildings based on different metrics and
                        how individual changes to different parameter starting from a template affect
                        the output of the generator in terms of the metrics and the resulting building.
                        The result from the analysis show that the polygon mathematics is well suited
                        for generating 3D buildings for games.</p>

                    <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> Through our work we validated the symmetry and leniency heuristics used to evaluate
                        content which has been procedurally generated in a mixed-initiative tool called the Evolutionary

                        from what a human player perceives the metrics to be. A user study was performed for which we

                    <strong>Title:</strong> Intuitive Interface for Pattern Recognition in Virtual Reality

                    <br>
                    
                    <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract: </strong> In this thesis we explore natural user interfaces and pattern recognition approaches. 
                        We did this by designing and developing an artifact which acts as an interactive spell-casting experience in virtual reality. In the artifact
                        the user draws patterns to cause magical effects, such as summoning balls of fire, and gusts of wind. While there
                        are other similar solutions available, they only allow a limited level of detail to the patterns that can be
                        recognised. To make an experience that feels intuitive to the user, an interface capable of detecting advanced
                        patterns is required. Furthermore, a pattern recognition solution able to read these advanced patterns, without
                        causing loss of frame rate, is an absolute prerequisite when the experience is entirely in virtual reality. We pose
                        the question: how can you create a natural user interface that reads a player's intricate hand motions to execute
                        various actions in a Virtual Reality gameplay environment?​ ​The pattern recognition system we developed is
                        based on template matching, supported by a syntactic pattern recognition approach. With our intuitive interface
                        we made it possible for the system to read a user’s drawn patterns in a 3D space as a 2D drawing. To keep it
                        easy for us to add new patterns to the system’s library, we created a system that allowed us to quickly and easily
                        add additional patterns for the system to recognise. We evaluated the artifact by conducting an experiment with
                        eleven participants. The experiment was a user study consisting of a structured observation, where the users got
                        to draw patterns as we observed them, followed by a semi-structured interview, to generate elaborate qualitative
                        data. The final artifact does not provide a viable solution in and of itself, but it does have great potential for
                        future work. The results show that the intuitiveness of the interface in a system like this relies heavily on the
                        other parts connected to the interface, such as the leniency on the accuracy of the pattern recognition system.</p>
